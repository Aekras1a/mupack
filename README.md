This is a small executable packer that I have been working on and off for some time. 
There is some bugs:

Most obvious known bugs:
* No load config directory support.

Virus scanners now scan for mupakk, making it somewhat useless now (thanks to people that abused it). 
Which is why hence a private version for me exists, to pack my own prods.

Source code might be useful for people who want to read how to develop a packer in mostly C though.
